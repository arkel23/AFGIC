# Awesome Fine-Grained Image Classification[![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

I tried to condense the (main) contributions (or the used methodology) from each paper into a line or two to observe trends across years.

Also made a companion website on [GitHub Pages](https://arkel23.github.io/AFGIC/)
with summaries of all papers for a year + 1-slide summary of close to 200 surveyed papers.

Paper scraping description in [link](docs/literature_scraping.md).

If you have any problems, suggestions or improvements, please submit the issue or PR.
